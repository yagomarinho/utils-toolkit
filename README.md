# utils-toolkit

This repository contains a collection of **general-purpose utility functions** I reuse across my projects.

It exists to centralize small helpers that don’t belong to a specific domain, framework, or layer, but still solve recurring problems in a consistent way.

## Philosophy

- Small and focused utilities
- Clear behavior over abstractions
- No framework or environment assumptions
- Reuse only what proves useful in practice

## How I use it

I use `utils-toolkit` as a shared toolbox for common helpers that sit outside domain logic and infrastructure concerns.

Functions are added gradually, based on real usage, and kept simple to avoid turning this repository into a generic or bloated utility library.

This repository reflects my personal conventions for handling cross-cutting utility code.
